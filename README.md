# Covid-Classifier-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This project is done to identify which of the ML models is best suited for classifying whether a person is affected by covid or pneumonia or is in normal state. The dataset contains 3 classes - Normal, Pnuemonia and Covid, where each contains about 120 chest x-ray images. I extract the features and then based on these features classify them into corresponding categories.
